# Cointiply_Bot
This bot will log into Cointiply.com, join the rain pool for additional coins, and complete all of the PTC ad offers.  The browser will need to stay open due to the manner in which the captchas are solved, but can be minimized (RBTray or another hide to tray program is great for keeping it out of the way).

***Due to the 25MB upload limit on github, the Windows standalone must be unzipped from the following parts:***<br>
	Cointiply_Bot_v1.07.zip.001<br>
